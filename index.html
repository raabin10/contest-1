    <h1>ABOUT US </h1>
    <p> privately owned conglomerate of nearly 100 companies encompassing several primary business sectors: chemicals,
        consumer products, energy, engineering, information systems, materials, and services. Headquarters are in
        Mumbai.
        The Tata Group was founded as a private trading firm in 1868 by entrepreneur and philanthropist Jamsetji
        Nusserwanji Tata. In 1902 the group incorporated the Indian Hotels Company to commission the Taj Mahal Palace &
        Tower, the first luxury hotel in India, which opened the following year. After Jamsetji’s death in 1904, his son
        Sir Dorab Tata took over as chair of the Tata Group. Under Dorab’s leadership the group quickly diversified,
        venturing into a vast array of new industries, including steel (1907), electricity (1910), education (1911),
        consumer goods (1917), and aviation (1932).
        Following Dorab's death in 1932, Sir Nowroji Saklatwala became the group's chair. Six years later Jehangir
        Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata (J.R.D.) took over the position. His continued expansion of the company into new
        sectors—such as chemicals (1939), technology (1945), cosmetics (1952), marketing, engineering, and manufacturing
        (1954), tea (1962), and software services (1968)—earned Tata Group international recognition. In 1945 Tata Group
        established the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO) to manufacture engineering and locomotive
        products; it was renamed Tata Motors in 2003. In 1991 J.R.D.’s nephew, Indian business mogul Ratan Tata,
        succeeded him as chairman of the Tata Group. Upon assuming leadership of the conglomerate, Ratan aggressively
        sought to expand it, and increasingly he focused on globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired
        London-based Tetley Tea, and in 2004 it purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of South Korea’s Daewoo
        Motors. In 2001 Tata Group partnered with American International Group, Inc. (AIG) to create the insurance
        company Tata-AIG.
        In 2007 Tata Steel completed the biggest corporate takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant
        Anglo-Dutch steel manufacturer Corus Group. </p>
